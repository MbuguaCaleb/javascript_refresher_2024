//1.Airthmetic Operators

let x;

x = 5 + 5;
x = 5 - 5;
x = 5 * 5;
x = 5 / 5;

//An Operation that returns the remainder
//Can come in very hadny for certain Operations
x = 5 % 5;
x = 7 % 5;

//Concatenation
// (Bring strings Together)
x = 'Hello' + 'World';
x = 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World';

//Exponent
x = 2 ** 3;

//Increment
x = 1;

// (Increment by One)
// (plus plus means plus one)
x = x + 1;
x++;

//Decrement

x = x - 1;
x--;

//Assignment Operators
//Single means assignment
x = 10;
x += 5;
x -= 5;
x *= 5;
x /= 5;
x **= 5;

//Comparison Operators
// == (Double Equals  is Comparison)
x = 2 == 2;
x = 2 == 4;

//Equal Type and Equal Value Op

// x = 2 == '2';

// (It is good to always use tripple Equals)
x = 2 === '2';

//Not Equals
x = 2 != 2;
x = 2 != '2';
x = 2 !== '2';

x = 10 > 5;
x = 10 < 5;
x = 10 <= 5;
x = 10 >= 5;
console.log(x);
